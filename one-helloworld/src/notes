each app can only return one element in react, so we can wrap up the elements into DIV

if u are having a bootstrap link then paste it in the public index.html

props - values passed in the components


states
const [count,setCount] = useState();
name any variable and then the next value should be set"variable_name"

always import the bootsstrap css first them import ur own css file
